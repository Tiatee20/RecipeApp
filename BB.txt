ingredients
4 large eggs
2 tbsp milk
Salt and pepper to taste
4 large flour tortillas
4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Salsa, avocado, or other toppings as desired
instructions
In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and pour in the egg mixture.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are set but still moist, about 3-4 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
Warm the tortillas in the microwave or on a griddle until pliable.
Divide the scrambled eggs, crumbled bacon, and shredded cheese evenly among the tortillas, placing the fillings in a line down the center of each tortilla.
Add any additional toppings as desired, such as salsa or avocado.
Fold in the sides of each tortilla and then roll up tightly, tucking in the ends as you go.
Serve the breakfast burritos immediately, or wrap in foil and keep warm in a low oven until ready to serve.
