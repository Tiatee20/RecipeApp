Meal: Breakfast
Prep: 15m
Easy-meals, 9-ingredients

Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tbsp sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla extract
Cooking spray or additional butter for cooking

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined (there may be some lumps, that's okay).
4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and spray with cooking spray or melt some additional butter in the pan.
5. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the pan or griddle, spacing the pancakes apart.
6. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
7. Flip the pancake and cook until the other side is golden brown, about another 1-2 minutes.
8. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed.
9. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as butter, syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.
